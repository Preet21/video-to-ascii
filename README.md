p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source.

Thanks to Daniel Shiffman for the amazing [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55iwMYv8tGI).

This project is based on p5.js and it renders a video feed by mapping each of 48\*48 pixels with some characters.

We can play with the intensity of the colors to get a well defined image boundary.
